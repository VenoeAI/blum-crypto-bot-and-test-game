# blum-crypto-bot-and-test-game
Contains a remake of the Blum crypto game in pygames and a couple of different bots that take different approaches to play the game, this ranges from the use of computer vision and image recognition models, to simple pixel camparison algoeithms.
The files are jumbled, but the game file is test.py, as for the rest, i wish you goodluck in finding the bot capabilities.
Any and all changes or suggestions are welcome.

# NOTE
You will need a very good pc to be able to use any of the bots without lag, timeout have been added on the bots to avoid cases of the bot running forever when the windows key 'Q' does not succcesfully quit the program.
